/// YOUTUBE MEDIA DOWNLOADER ///
I want to seperate this into multiple parts.
1. Container w/ a header asking for you to input the link 
2. Input below that that will take in the link information
3. A button to the right of the Input to start downloading. 

When the link is downloading I want the above things to disappear and for there to be a preview of the video as well as a progress bar of the download commencing. 
I think thats about everything I want to add with this.
